<p>God delights in His benevolent nature. He is kind, gracious, generous, patient, and loving. He is unrelenting in his
    care for us, and we are called to do the same with others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Bear one another&rsquo;s burdens and so fulfill the Law of Christ&rdquo; &ndash; Galatians 6:2</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you love one
        another&rdquo; &ndash; John 13:3-4</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but no deeds? Suppose a brother or sister is
        without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, &lsquo;Go, I wish you well: keep warm and well
        fed&rsquo;, but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it&rdquo; &ndash; James 2:14-16</em></p>
<p><em>Additional scriptures guidelines: Deuteronomy 15:7-8, Matthew 25:35-40, Isaiah 58:6-9, Jeremiah 22:16, Job
        29:12-16.</em></p>
<p>The SM desires to reflect the generous heart of God (Matthew 20:15). It is to be conducted with joy, not under
    compulsion, motivated by thankfulness to God for His generosity toward us (2 Corinthians 9:7).</p>
