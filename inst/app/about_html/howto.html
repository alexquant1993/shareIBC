<p><strong>Purpose of this app</strong></p>
<p>The "Share IBC" app was created with the purpose of creating a common space for the IBC church community that
        will allow its members to exchange job opportunities, offer their professional services and upcycle and donate
        different goods instead of throwing them away. It also includes all the relevant information on the
    Social Ministry, from the philosophy and purpose of the ministry to the services and activities it provides.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do with this app?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Share tab</strong></p>
<p>In this tab you will be able to search and post the following categories:</p>
<ul style="
    list-style: disc;
    padding-left: calc(var(--f7-list-item-padding-horizontal) + var(--f7-list-in-list-padding-left));
">
    <li><strong>Job opportunities:</strong> search for a job for yourself or contribute to your church community by
        posting a vacant position you might have heard of in your company, walking down the street in your neighborhood
        or in any social networks that you are part of.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional services:</strong> hire or offer your professional services. From French lessons to
        cleaning services, whatever the area of expertise, let&rsquo;s connect and share!</li>
    <li><strong>Upcycle and donate:</strong> you might have a baby troller that you are not longer using and you might
        want to donate and give it a second life rather than throw it away. Whether it&rsquo;s a chair, some jam jars,
        an old guitar, feel free to post it. Or maybe you&rsquo;re looking to acquire something yourself, please check
        this tab!</li>
    <li><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> share anything here that does not fall
    into the categories above. For instance: joining a small group or connecting with other Christians your age, rental needs, finding roommates, sports buddies (soccer, swimming, running, etc.), etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, posts have an approval workflow, once the post is submitted by the church member, it will be reviewed by
    the Social Ministry Team and if it is informationally complete and appropriate, it will be posted on the app.</p>
<p>All posts, once approved, will be available for 4 months before being removed from the app. If you wish to deactivate or remove your post before this time, please send an email to 'info@shareibcmadrid.com' with your post details.</p>
