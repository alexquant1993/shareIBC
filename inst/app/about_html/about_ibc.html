<p>IBC serves as church home for people from over 50 nations who enjoy worshiping in English in a very international
    church with fellow Christians from other continents and denominations, with different ethnic backgrounds and a vast
    variety of personal and professional experience. The church relates to both the International Baptist Convention and
    the Spanish Baptist Convention (UEBE), cooperating for the purposes of missions and Christian education. Our goal
    continues to be to know Christ, to learn to be His Body together, and to make Him known, among internationals, among
    Spaniards, and among the nations.</p>
