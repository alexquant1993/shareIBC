<p>The purpose of the SM is to assist members of IBC and those within our community&nbsp;to meet their financial needs
    according to biblical directives and the present policies.</p>
<p>Financial assistance, where appropriate, is intended as a source of last resort, to be used only when the family or
    individual requesting assistance has explored all other possibilities of help from family, friends, savings or
    investments. &nbsp;As with all forms of benevolence provided by the SM, financial assistance is intended to be a
    temporary help during a time of crisis or transition.</p>
