<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em>Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God
        loves a cheerful giver.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<em>2&ordm; Corinthians 9:7 (ESV)</em></p>
<p>Tithes and offerings can be given as&nbsp;<em>general gifts</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>special offerings</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>General gifts</strong></em><br />Freewill tithes and offerings are used to support the daily operations
    of the church. To meet our annual budget for missions, ministries, general expenses and salaries, we depend on the
    regular, undesignated giving of members and supporters.</p>
<p><em><strong>Special offerings</strong></em><br />For giving that exceeds your regular tithe, you can specify to which
    mission, ministry or project you want to designate your offering. If you want to donate to this Ministry, you could write &ldquo;IBC Social
    Ministry&rdquo; in the memo of your check or bank transfer.</p>
