<p>Extend the love and grace of Jesus Christ, with mercy and compassion by means of food, financial assistance,
    clothing, consultation, and training so that people&acute;s physical needs are met, encouraging them to seek God
    first as their ultimate Provider.</p>
<p>As servants of our Lord Jesus Christ, we are always willing to help when possible, seeking wisdom in all cases
    following the next key principles:</p>
<p>Knowing that all people have been made in God&acute;s image and are important to Him, we will receive those in need
    with dignity and compassion taking the time to know them and their situation. We will then help them create a plan
    to move out of a situation of need, while at the same time moving towards Christ.</p>
<p>In Christ, we mature in faith as we walk with other believers. Because of this we will minister to those in need by
    using a developmental approach in the context of an ongoing empowering relationship. Ideally this will result in
    each person in need coming to Christ and becoming part of the church family if they are not already.</p>
<p>Knowing that God calls each of us to good stewardship of what we have been given, we will use an asset-based approach
    so the persons in need may overcome their situation by faith and obedience as they use their God-given abilities,
    resources and skills.</p>
