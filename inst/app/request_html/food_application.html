    <li>The applicant must submit an <em>Application for Food Assistance </em> along with all the required documentation mentioned in the previous section. In addition,
        the applicant should also submit a Data Protection Form. This
        can be done in person with the help of the <em>Church Office Secretary</em> or emailed to <a
            href="about:blank">socialministry@ibcmadrid.com</a>.</li>
    <li>The <em>Social Ministry Committee </em>appoints an interviewer to attend
        to this request. Based on the information provided in the application, the interviewer might conduct an
        interview to:
        <ul style="
    list-style: circle;
    padding-left: calc(var(--f7-list-item-padding-horizontal) + var(--f7-list-in-list-padding-left));
">
            <li>Ask questions about the information on requester&rsquo;s application.</li>
            <li>Ask for proof of certain information.</li>
            <li>Request additional information that the interviewer might consider necessary to make a judgment on
                applicant&rsquo;s case.</li>
            <li>Explain any questions the applicant might have about the food program.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The SMC processes the request: the SMC will review the application and the recommendations of the designated
        interviewer to assess whether the applicant meets the eligibility criteria. When there is not clarity in
        judgment, the SMC will err on the side of giving rather than withholding the assistance.</li>
    <li>The interviewer will communicate to the applicant the decision of SMC in a maximum of 3 business days. If your
        request is approved, you will receive 12 food baskets in a period of 12 months, one basket for each month. In
        order to keep receiving the aid throughout the year, you will have to sign a <em>Statement of Compliance with
            the Eligibility Criteria </em> quarterly to declare that
        you still meet the food program eligibility criteria.
    </li>
    <li>At the end of the twelve months of duration of aid, the beneficiary will have to restart the application
        process.</li>
