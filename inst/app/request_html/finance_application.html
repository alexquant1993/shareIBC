    <li>The applicant must submit a <em>Request for Financial Assistance</em>. In addition, the applicant should also
        submit a Data Protection Form. This can be done in person with the help of the <em>Church Office Secretary</em>
        or emailed to <a href="about:blank">socialministry@ibcmadrid.com</a>.</li>
    <li>The SMC appoints a counselor to attend to this request. The counselor
        will conduct an interview to gather the information needed to complete
        the <em>Financial Aid Application</em>. It is not necessary to complete all the fields of the aforementioned
        form, the counselor must evaluate what is the minimum information required to make an adequate decision on the
        case. Nonetheless, in any case, a clear description of the following is always required: the applicant&rsquo;s
        financial situation and request (amount and purpose).</li>
    <li>If the counselor deems it necessary, the applicant must present all the supporting documentation that can prove
        the veracity of his/her request.</li>
    <li>The SMC processes the request: the SMC will review and will agree on the proper response to the request and
        ensure that it meets the stipulations of the philosophy and policies stipulated in this document. If the request
        is approved, the SMC will determine the amount of assistance to be disbursed. When there is not clarity in
        judgment, the SMC will err on the side of giving rather than withholding financial assistance.</li>
    <li>The SMC will then notify the <em>Church Office Secretary</em> of their determination in order to proceed with
        the disbursement of funds.</li>
    <li>Approved requests are allocated within 3-5 working days.</li>
    <li>Upon receiving financial aid, all recipients must send a confirmation email to <a
            href="about:blank">info@ibcmadrid.com</a> or <a href="about:blank">socialministry@ibcmadrid.com</a>. Another
        option is to sign in person a receipt handed by the <em>Church Office Secretary</em>.</li>
    <li>If a different need arises in the future, a new request must be made and approved.</li>
