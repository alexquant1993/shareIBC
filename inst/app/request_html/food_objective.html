<p>The Social Ministry food program aims to help those in need within the IBC community with a monthly food basket. The overall purpose is to provide additional support to supplement household food costs.
The total funds allocated to the food program will be distributed taking into account the household size and its financial situation. A larger basket will be delivered to larger families who have greater economic needs.
