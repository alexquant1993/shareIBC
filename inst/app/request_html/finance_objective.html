<p>The Social Ministry Funds are intended to cover unusual, sudden,
    or severe needs. Although distributions can
    take place over an extended period of time, the ultimate purpose
    of this ministry is not to provide financial sustenance.
    Therefore, individuals requiring long-term assistance should
    look first to their family members, if possible, if not,
    they should be redirected to the appropriate government agencies.</p>
