<p>The following criteria is intended to serve as general guidelines that will help the Social Ministry Committee
    (henceforth, SMC) to have a more structured decision-making process. Nevertheless, each case will be analyzed
    thoroughly, considering all relevant details and conditions of each applicant. In this sense, some of these
    guidelines can be overlooked if the SMC deems it necessary.</p>

"> 
    <li>Individuals with full capacity to work (both mental and physical) and who do not show the required efforts to
        secure gainful employment do not qualify for financial assistance under normal conditions.</li>
    <li>All candidates for financial assistance must be willing to meet with a member of the SMC or a designated
        counselor, before, during, and after receiving assistance. The counselor may require the applicant to provide
        additional financial information or to follow additional recommendations (i.e., expense reductions, employment
        and career advice, etc.).</li>
    <li>Money will be distributed through bank-to-bank transfer; payments being made directly to the institution that is
        owed. Cash will only be given to the recipient as a last option.</li>
    <li>Financial aid to a person or a household will be limited, if possible, to no more than once per quarter and a
        maximum of &euro; 300 per application.</li>
    <li>In any case, the total disbursements per each request should not be more than 10% in total of the current
        available budget of the Social Ministry (henceforth, SM).</li>
    <li>Previous financial assistance will be taken into account if future requests are made. If the SMC determines that
        the applicant requires a developmental approach:

    padding-left: calc(var(--f7-list-item-padding-horizontal) + var(--f7-list-in-list-padding-left));
">
            <li>A counselor will be appointed. The counselor will meet and support the beneficiary to make the necessary
                changes to alleviate their current financial situation.</li>
            <li>Before any money is disbursed, the counselor has to ensure that the recipient owns the process of change
                and is taking steps to make a long-term lasting change. The ultimate goal is that the recipient
                glorifies God by taking full responsibility of their situation and by working and supporting themselves
                and their families with the fruits of their work.</li>
            <li>The counselor must monitor the progress of the beneficiary and communicate it to the SM Leader on a
                constant basis.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Benefiting from other initiatives of the SM such as clothing drives and food program does not disqualify the
        applicant for financial assistance. However, this data will be taken into account to grasp a better
        understanding of the situation of the individual.</li>
    <li>All candidates for financial assistance must complete the <em>Financial Aid Application</em> before or after the
        financial disbursement at discretion of the SMC.</li>
    <li>Financial disbursements are approved as designated by policy. Instructions are then provided to the <em>Church
            Office Secretary</em> by the person authorizing the aid.</li>
