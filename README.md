The “Share IBC” app was created with the purpose of creating a common
space for the IBC church community that will allow its members to
exchange job opportunities, offer their professional services and
upcycle and donate different goods instead of throwing them away. It
also includes all the relevant information on the Social Ministry, from
the philosophy and purpose of the ministry to the services and
activities it provides.

## What can you do with this app?

### Share tab

In this tab you will be able to search and post the following
categories:

-   **Job opportunities:** search for a job for yourself or contribute
    to your church community by posting a vacant position you might have
    heard of in your company, walking down the street in your
    neighborhood or in any social networks that you are part of.
-   **Professional services:** hire or offer your professional services.
    From French lessons to cleaning services, whatever the area of
    expertise, let’s connect and share!
-   **Upcycle and donate:** you might have a baby troller that you are
    not longer using and you might want to donate and give it a second
    life rather than throw it away. Whether it’s a chair, some jam jars,
    an old guitar, feel free to post it. Or maybe you’re looking to
    acquire something yourself, please check this tab!
-   **Miscellaneous:** share anything here that does not fall into the
    categories above. For instance: joining a small group or connecting
    with other Christians your age, rental needs, finding roommates,
    sports buddies (soccer, swimming, running, etc.), etc.

In any case, posts have an approval workflow, once the post is submitted
by the church member, it will be reviewed by the Social Ministry Team
and if it is informationally complete and appropriate, it will be posted
on the app.
